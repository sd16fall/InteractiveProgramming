This is the code for a Mars Dragon capsule landing game.

To get it to work you will need to install Python 2.7 as well as py.game - a module
for creating simple raster games using Python

You then run mars_lander_mvc.py to start and play the game

You use the a and d keys to control the sideways translation of the lander and the up
arrow to thrust upwards. Thrust is a constant and you have unlimitted restarts
of the engines. TO successfully land you must contact the ground will traveling
at a velocity less then 100 px/second

Have fun!
