Word! Two players cooperate to cancel all the bricks on the screen, in a classic spin on the original brick breaker.

# Installation

You can install the `pygame` library by executing the following command:

If any player fails to intercept the ball before it touches the edge of the screen, the game will end, and the player loses.

# Game Control

The only thing that players can control is the movement of the bars.

Each player has his/her own bar and at the beginning - the bar for player 1 will be on the lower left corner of the screen, and the bar for player 2 will be on the upper right corner of the screen.

Controls:

Player 1:
- Left - Left arrow key
- Right - Right arrow key

Player 2:
- Left - Q
- Right - E

# Restarting the Game
Hitting "R" when the game is over will allow both players to restart within the game.
